# Priority Framework

*Last updated: Initial version*

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Meaning | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|---------|---------------|----------|
| **P0** | Critical | Immediate | Security vuln, data loss, complete breakage |
| **P1** | High | This cycle | Major user impact, key features |
| **P2** | Medium | Next 2-4 cycles | Improvements, nice-to-haves |
| **P3** | Low | Backlog | Polish, future considerations |

## Prioritization Inputs

| Source | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Security Analyst | High for security | Safety first |
| SRE | High for reliability | Stability matters |
| Home User | Medium | Core audience |
| Advanced User | Medium | Power users |
| Tech Lead | Medium | Maintainability |
| Product Owner | Medium | Business value |

## Conflict Resolution

When personas disagree:
1. Safety/security wins over features
2. User impact wins over internal quality
3. Short-term stability over long-term optimization
4. Document reasoning for future reference
