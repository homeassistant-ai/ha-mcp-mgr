# Home User - Beliefs & Observations

*Last updated: Initial setup*

## Core Beliefs

### Usability
- If I can't do it in a few tries, it's too hard
- Error messages should tell me what to do next
- Default should work without configuration

### Automation Expectations
- I should be able to describe automations in plain language
- Time-based triggers are the most common
- Sensor-based triggers (motion, temperature) are everyday use
- I understand triggers, conditions, actions conceptually

### What I Value
- Reliability over advanced features
- Simple workflows that just work
- Clear confirmation of what happened
- Easy undo when I make mistakes

## Automation Competency

### What I Can Do
- Create time-based automations (sunset, schedules)
- Create sensor-triggered automations (motion, temperature)
- Understand conditions (if home, if dark)
- Enable/disable automations
- Troubleshoot why something didn't run

### What I Struggle With
- Complex nested conditions
- Template syntax
- YAML editing
- Finding the right entity IDs

## Observations Log

### Week of [Date] - Initial
- Haven't tested yet
- Will try common automation patterns
